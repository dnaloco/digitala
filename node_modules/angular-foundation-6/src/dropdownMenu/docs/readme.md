A directive that provides the [Foundation Dropdown Menu](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/topbar.html) component.

The directive relies on the same markup as the original Foundation Dropdown Menu. 

The following settings can be applied as attributes to the root element with the ```dropdown-menu``` attribute:

- `disable-hover`: A mouse hover event will no open the root menu.
- `disable-click-open`: Click events will not open menus, only hover (not implemented yet).
- `closing-time`: Amount of time to delay closing a submenu on a mouseleave event. Default is 500ms

See the demo page for example on how to use this and visit the [Foundation docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/dropdown-menu.html) for more details.
