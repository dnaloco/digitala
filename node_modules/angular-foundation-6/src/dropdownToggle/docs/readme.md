DropdownToggle is a simple directive which will toggle a dropdown link on click.  Simply put it on the toggler-element, and it will find the target element and toggle it when the element matching the value of the `dropdown-toggle` attribute is clicked.

The following settings can be applied as attributes to the root element:

- `close-on-click`: Allows a click on the body to close the dropdown.
- `pane-align`: Determines how the dropdown-pane should be aligned from the toggle.
- `toggle-on-hover`: Toggles the dropdown-pane when hovering over the toggle instead of on click.
